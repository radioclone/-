# Astar Grant Application: retroverse Creator Economy
## Build2Earn Grant Application

### Project Overview
**Project Name**: retroverse Creator Economy Infrastructure  
**Category**: Creator Tools & DeFi Infrastructure  
**Primary Chain**: Astar (Advanced Creator Tools)  
**Secondary Chain**: Soneium (Mainstream Onboarding)  

### Executive Summary
retroverse is a cross-chain creator economy platform that bridges mainstream creators from Soneium to Astar's advanced Build2Earn ecosystem. We provide sophisticated creator tools, multi-chain reputation, and decentralized monetization infrastructure specifically designed for the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Problem Statement
**The Advanced Creator Economy Gap**

Current Web3 creator platforms lack:
- **Sophisticated DeFi integration** for complex creator monetization models
- **Cross-chain reputation systems** that work across Polkadot ecosystem
- **Advanced governance tools** for creator collectives and DAOs
- **Build2Earn integration** that rewards platform development contributions
- **Multi-VM capabilities** leveraging both EVM and WASM environments

**Opportunity**: $50B creator economy needs advanced Web3 infrastructure beyond simple NFT minting.
